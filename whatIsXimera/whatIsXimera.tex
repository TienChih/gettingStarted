\maketitle

Ximera seeks to help authors build PDF files and online content
simultaneously. Our strategy to achieve this goal, is to separate
content from deployment.


An author writes their content in a \LaTeX\ document, this can produce
a PDF. Next the author post the file to GitHub. From this the Ximera interpreter can post the file in an online form:
