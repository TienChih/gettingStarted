This activity contains some possible solutions
to issues that may arise
\end{abstract}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Be careful when pasting the key into
the webhook secret field. Be sure that no extra
spaces were copied. Push the \verb!Update webhook! button on
\href{http://github.org}{\tt github.org}
after correcting the secret.

\item To see updates on the course webpage
after pushing changes through \verb!git!,
push the browser's refresh button
and then click the \verb!Update activity! button 
on the course page. Deleting your browser's cache
may also resolve certain issues.

\item The optional scaling argument of \verb!\includegraphics!
may not work.

\item The preamble of every activity file needs to 
include a \verb!\title! command. 

\item The abstract of every activity file
needs to occur after \verb!\begin{document}!.

\item A good way to check for \TeX\ typing mistakes
is to run \LaTeX\ on the \TeX\ files. Indeed, this
is good practice and additionally can be used
to create handouts for students.
